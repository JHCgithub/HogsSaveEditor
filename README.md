Hogs of War Save Editor v1.2.1

A save editor for hogs of war

Zipped folder in .rar format. (you'll need 7-zip or WinRar installed to extract currently) Extract the contents into a folder of your choice.

Should be fairly intuitive. There's a couple quirks such as map locations being different ingame on PC that i've not accounted for. 

Using the _ (underscore) in a pigs name will turn it into a heart ingame.

Should work with PC saves, indivudal PSX hardware save from a memorycard, and PS1 virtual memory cards (tested on DuckStation mostly)

The current version V1.2.1 should reliably work with PC, Emulator Memory Cards, and Original hardware saves:
	
	-Choices for different save blocks for a Virtual memory card
	-Choices for any save slot within a given save. Each Hogs of war save on a PSX platform allows 11 save slots

When saving a New Savegame, remember to name the file appropriately so that it matches that of the emulator memorycard or hardware platform you are using. For PC it's savearmyX, Where X is the save slot number

Purple team assignement is disabled on the first mission as it will always cause a crash due to the main screen not having an asset for the purple team.

Any bugs found, let me know. Intend to get this working with genuine PS1 saves to at some point, for those who have the ability to get save files from the consoles.

Also plan to add the ability to choose save blocks if there's multiple on one card. As well as additional saves within those blocks.

1.2.1 - Fixed an overlooked issue with the size of generated new saves for original hardware. Cleaned up memory management a bit.
